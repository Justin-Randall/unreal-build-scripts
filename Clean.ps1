.SYNOPSIS
  Remove all generated build artifacts so that the project is back
  to a pristine state (as if no builds have ever been run).

.DESCRIPTION
  This script will delete the common Unreal build output folders:
    - Intermediate/
    - Binaries/
    - Saved/
    - Packaged/    (if present)
    - Intermediate\BuildLogs/
    - Intermediate\CodeCoverage/

  All deletions are silent and non-destructive to your source files.
